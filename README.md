## About Social Gratitude
Don't we all want to make the world a better place?
We all need to know we are needed. So why not starting by letting your friend know, the other day, they really helped you. You will make their day!
If you think a user might need an extra boost of humanity and help, go ahead and schedule a call with them. Safely, over our platform.

<br>

## About why
We live in a fast paced world full of pressure to be best and better.
Our goal with this project was to raise awareness in people. Our days are full with little things and gestures that makes us smile and yet we always see the things that bring us down.
It feels good to acknowledge the positive things as well as for people around us to know they could help making our day just a bit better.
